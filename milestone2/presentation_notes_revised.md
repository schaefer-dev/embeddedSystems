# interresting events in demo video:
- 3.5s collector senses scout with proximity sensor and pushes enough to lead scout out of bounds (9s)
- 50s collector attacks opponent scout again, afterwards opponent collector, but stops attacks because internal coordinates get close to out of bounds
- 68s collector tries to attack collector, but loses vision
- 72s collector tries to attack collector, but loses vision
- 77s collector pushes collector out of bounds, but due to his estimated position drives out of bounds himself
- 97s scout senses good light position, but estimated position is at different location -> sets destination there
- 100s updates arrives just in time for the scout to set a perfect location for the real gathering point
- 102s updates position again
- 106s updates position again
- 110s collector arrives at gathering position, but light already passed
- 111s collector ignores opponent in front of him because last light update is fairly new -> prioritizes gathering light
